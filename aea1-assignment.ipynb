    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is interesting. As an important model, Bertrand-Edgeworth model shed light on the behavior of firms in competition in which capacity is endogenous. This framework enables economists to analyze the market competition in a more complex scenario. In some of Betrand-Edgeworth models, there are symmetric equilibria, such as Kreps & Sheinkman (1983). And in some models, pure strategy equilibrium does not exist. Reynolds & Wilson (2000) is one of the few models with asymmetric pure strategy equilibrium with demand uncertainty. This model can help to analyze the competitions between firms with different capacities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of competition is very common in reality. Furthermore, some important competition strategies may happen in this case, such as predatory buying. This model provide a good way to further people’s understanding on these strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in Reynolds & Wilson’s paper (2000), although the asymmetric pure strategy equilibria exist, it is too difficult to obtain the analytical solution of the model in a simple way of calculating. So actually, they did not provide the analytical solutions of this model in their results. This can be an obstacle for the analysis that focuses on scenario that this model intend to depict or even more complicated cases. In this assignment, we hope to use python to find the analytical solutions of this. Our conclusion will be instrumental in understanding this model.\n"

    "In our model, we introduce a new assumption, which is the inverse demand function of input market. Because the marginal cost of input will be higher if the firms purchase more input. This may have ambiguous effect on the asymmetric equilibrium. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, this new assumption makes this model more difficult to solve.  In the model of Reynolds & Wilson (2000), the author have to admit that it is not easy to find the analytical solution of the model. The inability to solve the polynomial of reaction functions makes the analysis more difficult. In this assignment, by using the symbolic operation of Python, we overcome this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above analysis, despite some changes in the assumption, we can still reproduce some results of Reynolds & Wilson (2000), though not all of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "With new assumptions, our model has fewer equilibria than theirs. However, the only nontrivial solution have a lot in common with the solutions in their model. The capacities are still asymmetric.\n"
